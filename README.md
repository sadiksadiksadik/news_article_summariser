# news_article_summariser

Just learning how to scrape with various libraries, the ultimate purpose is to create a more convenient and digestible means of processing the news, without being bombarded by apps and derived from a cross section of various sources. S

I am learning how to build and test various methods of retreiving and filtering news. The end goal would be an ad free, open source clean news aggregator.
I will be using various NLP libraries to see whichever can best summarise news article content while maintaining structural coherence. 

The desire is to present the news in an uncolourful, extremely basic and only text based format. No advertisments, no shock value, no imagery.

The sources that later iterations will use to populate a future app or web app, will be organisations that are reputated to have the highest standards of journalistic
integreity, as determined by IMPRESS, an independent organisation that measures journalistic standards and ethics, awarding registered publication status to those that meet their criteria.
