# news_article_summariser

Just learning how to scrape with various libraries, the ultimate purpose is to create a more convenient way to present the news and also, a more digestible.


I am learning how to build and test various methods of retreiving and filtering news. The end goal would be an ad free, open source clean news aggregator.
I will be using various NLP libraries to see whichever can best summarise news article content, while maintaining structural coherence, with a desire to
present the news in an uncolourful, extremely basic, only text based format. With no imagery, advertisements, or shock value.
